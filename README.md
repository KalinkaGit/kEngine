# kEngine

kEngine is a 3D rendering engine that I work on in my free time.

This engine will not be maintained over time.

This project is intended solely to be educational.

## Purposes
Why does this project exist?

1. I wanted to improve in C++
2. Learn to do 3D with OpenGL
3. Make an engine to reuse it on my own projects
4. I love to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut
